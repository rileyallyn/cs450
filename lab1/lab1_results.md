1. Requirements and Ideation
    - More Creative; Figuring out ideas, nothing is set in stone
2. Design and Architecture
    - Creative; Getting input on architecture, then you as a human can pick out the ideas you like
3. Implementation
    - Consistent; You have already architected out the system, you do not want the AI going off and writing something you did not architect
4. Testing & QA
    - Creative; You want to be able to test edge cases, which requires some type of creativity 
5. Deployment & Maintenance
    - Consistent; So nothing breaks
