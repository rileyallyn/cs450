### Question 5.1.1

Yes, usually we get a better answer when giving the context of "CS450". The only exception I have found is when asking about Week of Worship, since its not directly apart of "CS450"

### Question 5.1.2

I see some weird issues with RAG where it answers with minimal simullarity. AKA a similuarity value under ```0.50```

### Question 5.1.3

As previously mentioned usually asking with CS450 in context, it will give a better answer, but if you put CS450 when asking a question not directly related to the class, it will automatically give "I don't know". This is probably because we use "CS450" instead of CPTR450.
